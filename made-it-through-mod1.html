          <h2>Made it through Mod1!</h2>
          <h4>April 28, 2017</h4>
          <p>Back on March 13, I started the first 6-week module at Turing School of Software and Design, and it has turned out to be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences in my life. I was drawn to Turing based on their mission and my first-hand experience at a Try Turing weekend. The program is broken down into 4 6-week modules, with the first module being focused on Ruby and learning the basics of being a software engineer. In Mod1 I completed several individual projects as well as two paired projects, which incorporated a LOT of learning around the workflow tool Git.<br />
          <br />My favorite technical concept I from the first module was the understanding of how ANYTHING can be abstracted into code, and especially the flexibility of this in Object Oriented Programming. I come to Turing with 8 years experience as a technical medical device engineer, where I worked in manufacturing to improve processes,  reduce/eliminate defect rates and reduce cost of the product. While I learned a tremendous amount about medical devices and how manufacturing/design can directly affect patient outcome, almost all the defects and issues could be traced back to human error. Whether it was a less than optimal design that failed to address all possible failure modes, or simply a person making an error when following a procedure, almost every root cause analysis was a result of a human being human.<br />
          <br />Last year I found out the Colorado branch of the company I worked at was being shut down and I would be laid off about the same time google announced they had defeated a master in the game of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/googles-ai-wins-fifth-final-game-go-genius-lee-sedol/">Go.</a> I had also recently learned about Merck and other pharmaceutical companies utilizing machine learning to find the best <a href="http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/">drug molecules.</a> It occurred to me how medical device companies might use similar programs to identify and fix potential failure modes to improve design and reduce the probability of a poor patient outcome. Even with just my basic understanding of programming I am starting to see how this could work, and how I might be able to use this technology someday if I keep learning and progressing. Now that we can model, test and simulate use of anything digitally, I am very excited for the future and combining software with medical devices to help patients!</p>
